# E-Commerce Backend

## Description

This backend application for an e-commerce website is built using Express.js and Sequelize, and connects to a PostgreSQL database. It is designed to handle categories, products, and tags for the e-commerce platform. The application uses the latest technologies to ensure robust functionality and competitive performance.

## Features

- **Express.js API**: Provides endpoints to manage categories, products, and tags.
- **Sequelize ORM**: Interfaces with a PostgreSQL database to handle data operations.
- **Environment Configuration**: Uses environment variables for database connection details.
- **Database Seeding**: Initializes the database with test data.

## User Story

As a manager at an internet retail company, you need a backend for your e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies so your company can compete effectively. 

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Database Configuration**
   - Add your database name, PostgreSQL username, and PostgreSQL password to an environment variable file.
   - The backend should connect to the database using Sequelize.

2. **Database Initialization**
   - Run schema and seed commands to create and seed a development database.

3. **Server Initialization**
   - Start the server and ensure Sequelize models are synced with the PostgreSQL database.

4. **API Testing**
   - Use Insomnia Core or a similar tool to test API GET routes for categories, products, or tags. Data should be displayed in formatted JSON.
   - Test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes to successfully create, update, and delete data in the database.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mine-mod/e-commerce-back-end.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```sh
   cd e-commerce-backend
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) installed. Install the required Node.js packages:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

   **.env**
   ```env
   DB_NAME=your_database_name
   DB_USER=your_postgres_username
   DB_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_DIALECT=postgres
   ```

   Replace `your_database_name`, `your_postgres_username`, and `your_postgres_password` with your actual database credentials.

5. **Initialize the Database**

   Run the following commands to create and seed the database:

 ```sh
   npm run seed
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start the Server**

   Run the following command to start the application:

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

   The server will start and the Sequelize models will be synced with the PostgreSQL database.

2. **Test the API**

   Use [Insomnia Core](https://insomnia.rest/) or a similar API client to test the following endpoints:

   - **GET /api/categories**: Retrieve all categories.
   - **GET /api/products**: Retrieve all products.
   - **GET /api/tags**: Retrieve all tags.
   - **POST /api/categories**: Create a new category.
   - **POST /api/products**: Create a new product.
   - **POST /api/tags**: Create a new tag.
   - **PUT /api/categories/:id**: Update an existing category.
   - **PUT /api/products/:id**: Update an existing product.
   - **PUT /api/tags/:id**: Update an existing tag.
   - **DELETE /api/categories/:id**: Delete a category.
   - **DELETE /api/products/:id**: Delete a product.
   - **DELETE /api/tags/:id**: Delete a tag.

   Ensure that data is displayed in formatted JSON and that POST, PUT, and DELETE operations work as expected.

## Project Structure

- `config/`: Contains the database configuration file.
- `models/`: Contains Sequelize models for categories, products, and tags.
- `migrations/`: Contains Sequelize migration files for schema setup.
- `seeders/`: Contains Sequelize seed files for populating the database with test data.
- `routes/`: Contains Express.js route handlers.
- `index.js`: Main entry point of the application.

## Troubleshooting

- **Database Connection Error**: Ensure PostgreSQL is running and the credentials in the `.env` file are correct.
- **Missing Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to ensure all required packages are installed.
- **File Paths**: Verify that all file paths in the code are correct and that necessary files exist.
